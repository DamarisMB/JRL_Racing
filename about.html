        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>JRL Racing is not just a brand; it’s a tribute to the life and passion of Jake Ryan Lewis. 
            Jake, a lifelong motorcycling enthusiast, found freedom and joy in the open road. His love 
            for racing and riding was at the heart of his identity in Orange County. Damaris, his partner, 
            grew up around bikes, with her dad and uncles all being avid riders. She was on motorcyles
            as a child but as she grew older riding stopped. But it wasn’t until Damaris met Jake, who 
            reignited her passion for the sport that she rediscovered her love for riding.</p>

        <p>Together, they began to dream up a vision—custom motorcycle jackets that would reflect
            both the freedom of riding and their personal style.</p>
        
        <p>Jake always struggled to find jackets that fit right as a body builder. And as the years went on
            and Damaris and him were in the works of launching their YouTube channel together on motorcycles
            and customizing their bikes. And this is how the idea was born, he wanted her to create him a custom 
            riding jacket for their channel that they could wear while riding. To Jake, it would hold more meaning
            and value knowing it was designed and fit on him by her. He knew other local riders that would benefit with 
            custom jackets but wanted to put his own twist by helping her design it as a fellow rider. </p>

        <p>Damaris with had a career in Fashion for the last 10 years at the time, Jake knew they had to utalize
            her technical design experience in the fashion industry to bring an idea to life. Damaris and Jake 
            began to bring their shared vision to life—designing custom jackets for riders. Together, they 
            created sketches and discussed how to make their mark in the world of motorcycle gear. 
            Unfortunately, Jake’s passing in 2021 left Damaris to carry on their dream alone.
        
            In his honor, JRL Racing was born. Every design and product is a tribute to Jake’s love for racing, 
            the passion they shared, and the legacy they wanted to leave behind. Damaris is committed to carrying 
            out this vision and creating a space where riders can find gear that reflects their freedom and 
            individuality—just as Jake lived.
